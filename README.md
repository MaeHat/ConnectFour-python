ConnectFour game

Classic ConnectFour in a 6x7 board. You can find also TicTacToe game. This is to play and to understand how can we use the alpha-beta search in AI. In this game we can not use a MiniMax search method or alpha-beta full search, because it's not possible to explore all state. 
There are also a simple heuristic that simulates how the game explore the paths that can lead to success. You can try to choose another heuristic, play with your friend ... Enjoy !!
