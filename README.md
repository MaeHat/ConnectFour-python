# ConnectFour-python
ConnectFour game

Classic ConnectFour in a 6x7 board. You can find also TicTacToe game. This is to play and to understand how can we use the alpha-beta search in IA. In this game we can never use a MiniMax search method or alpha-beta full search, because it's not possible to explore all state. 
There are also a simple heuristic that simulates how the game explore the paths that can lead to seccess. You can try to choose another heuristic. Enjoy !!
